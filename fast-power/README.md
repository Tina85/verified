# fast-power

Idea comes from [A Gentle Introduction to Type Classes and Relations in Coq](http://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/CoqArt/TypeClassesTut/typeclassestut.pdf).

* Monoid typeclass.
* Verified fast power algorithm (exponentiation by squaring), and generalized to
  all monoids.
* Use matrix and this technique to calculate fibnoacci numbers efficiently.
