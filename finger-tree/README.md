# finger-tree

Formalized with subset type (Sigma type).

Note, it is possible to formalize the predicate that all digits are of length
within `4` using inductive types, rather than `{ l : list A | 1 <= length l <= 4 }`.
Hereby I just want to exercise the cool dependent type.

TODO: append, monoid.
